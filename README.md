Alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients](https://bitwarden.com/download/).

Vaultwarden is the perfect self-hosted solution when running the official service is too resource-heavy.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was known as Bitwarden_RS and has been renamed to separate itself from the official Bitwarden server in the hopes of avoiding confusion and trademark/branding issues. Please see [#1642](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/discussions/1642) for more explanation.
> 
> This project is not associated with the [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) project nor Bitwarden, Inc.

> [!TIP]
> [Please report any bugs or suggestions to us directly](#get-in-touch), regardless of whatever clients you are using (mobile, desktop, browser...).
> 
> Do not use the official support channels.

## Features

A full implementation of the Bitwarden API:

 * Organizations
 * Attachments and send
 * Vault API
 * Serving static files
 * Website icons
 * Authenticator and U2F
 * YubiKey and Duo
 * Emergency Access

## Installation

Pull the docker image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage:

```sh
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run -d --name vaultwarden -v /vw-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped -p 80:80 vaultwarden/server:latest
```

This will preserve any persistent data under `/vw-data/`. You can adapt the path to whatever suits you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Most modern web browsers disallow the use of Web Crypto APIs in insecure contexts. In this case, you might get an error like `Cannot read property 'importKey'`. To solve this problem, you need to access the web vault via HTTPS or localhost.

This can be configured in [vaultwarden directly](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-HTTPS) or using a [third-party reverse proxy](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples).

If you have an available domain name, you can get HTTPS certificates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or you can generate self-signed certificates with utilities like [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). Some proxies automatically do this step, like [Caddy](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Proxy-examples).

## Usage
See the [vaultwarden wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki).
