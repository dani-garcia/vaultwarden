# NOTE: Temporary allowlist for Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception

Branch: `remediations/allow-apache-llvm-exception`

Purpose: Add a timeboxed allowlist entry for `Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception` to `deny.toml` to unblock CI while the maintainers pursue upstream or replacement remediation for `ar_archive_writer`.

Timebox: Remove no later than 2026-02-10 (90 days from addition).

Tracking: See `issues/TRACK-2025-11-09-RSA-PASTE.md` and PR #2 for the remediation plan and tasks.
