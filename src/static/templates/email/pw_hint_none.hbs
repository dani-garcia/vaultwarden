Your master password hint
<!---------------->
You (or someone) recently requested your master password hint. Unfortunately, your account does not have a master password hint.

If you cannot remember your master password, there is no way to recover your data. The only option to gain access to your account again is to delete the account ( {{url}}/#/recover-delete ) so that you can register again and start over. All data associated with your account will be deleted.

If you did not request your master password hint you can safely ignore this email.
