Your Email Change
<!---------------->
A user ({{ acting_address }}) recently tried to change their account to use this email address ({{ existing_address }}). You already have been invited to join Vaultwarden using this address.

To change your email address you first would have to delete the account associated with this email address ({{ existing_address }}):
Request account deletion: {{url}}/#/recover-delete

Once that is done you can change the email address of your existing account to this address. Any invitation would have to be redone.

If you did not try to change an email address, contact your administrator.
