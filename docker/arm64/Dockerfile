####################### VAULT BUILD IMAGE  #######################
# The web-vault digest specifies a particular web-vault build on Docker Hub.
# Using the digest instead of the tag name provides better security,
# as the digest of an image is immutable, whereas a tag name can later
# be changed to point to a malicious image.
#
# To verify the current digest for a given tag name:
# - From https://hub.docker.com/r/vaultwarden/web-vault/tags,
#   click the tag name to view the digest of the image it currently points to.
# - From the command line:
#     $ docker pull vaultwarden/web-vault:v2.21.1
#     $ docker image inspect --format "{{.RepoDigests}}" vaultwarden/web-vault:v2.21.1
#     [vaultwarden/web-vault@sha256:29a4fa7bf3790fff9d908b02ac5a154913491f4bf30c95b87b06d8cf1c5516b5]
#
# - Conversely, to get the tag name from the digest:
#     $ docker image inspect --format "{{.RepoTags}}" vaultwarden/web-vault@sha256:29a4fa7bf3790fff9d908b02ac5a154913491f4bf30c95b87b06d8cf1c5516b5
