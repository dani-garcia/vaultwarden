## Bitwarden_RS Configuration File
## Uncomment any of the following lines to change the defaults

## Main data folder
# DATA_FOLDER=data

## Database URL
## When using SQLite, this is the path to the DB file, default to %DATA_FOLDER%/db.sqlite3
## When using MySQL, this it is the URL to the DB, including username and password:
## Format: mysql://[user[:password]@]host/database_name
# DATABASE_URL=data/db.sqlite3

## Individual folders, these override %DATA_FOLDER%
# RSA_KEY_FILENAME=data/rsa_key
# ICON_CACHE_FOLDER=data/icon_cache
# ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER=data/attachments

## Templates data folder, by default uses embedded templates
## Check source code to see the format
# TEMPLATES_FOLDER=/path/to/templates
## Automatically reload the templates for every request, slow, use only for development
# RELOAD_TEMPLATES=false

## Client IP Header, used to identify the IP of the client, defaults to "X-Client-IP"
## Set to the string "none" (without quotes), to disable any headers and just use the remote IP
# IP_HEADER=X-Client-IP

## Cache time-to-live for successfully obtained icons, in seconds (0 is "forever")
# ICON_CACHE_TTL=2592000
## Cache time-to-live for icons which weren't available, in seconds (0 is "forever")
# ICON_CACHE_NEGTTL=259200

## Web vault settings
# WEB_VAULT_FOLDER=web-vault/
# WEB_VAULT_ENABLED=true

## Enables websocket notifications
# WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=false

## Controls the WebSocket server address and port
# WEBSOCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
# WEBSOCKET_PORT=3012

## Enable extended logging, which shows timestamps and targets in the logs
# EXTENDED_LOGGING=true

## Logging to file
## It's recommended to also set 'ROCKET_CLI_COLORS=off'
# LOG_FILE=/path/to/log

## Logging to Syslog
## This requires extended logging
## It's recommended to also set 'ROCKET_CLI_COLORS=off'
# USE_SYSLOG=false

## Log level
## Change the verbosity of the log output
## Valid values are "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error" and "off"
## Setting it to "trace" or "debug" would also show logs for mounted 
## routes and static file, websocket and alive requests
# LOG_LEVEL=Info

## Enable WAL for the DB
## Set to false to avoid enabling WAL during startup.
## Note that if the DB already has WAL enabled, you will also need to disable WAL in the DB,
## this setting only prevents bitwarden_rs from automatically enabling it on start.
## Please read project wiki page about this setting first before changing the value as it can
## cause performance degradation or might render  the service unable to start.
# ENABLE_DB_WAL=true

## Disable icon downloading
## Set to true to disable icon downloading, this would still serve icons from $ICON_CACHE_FOLDER,
## but it won't produce any external network request. Needs to set $ICON_CACHE_TTL to 0,
## otherwise it will delete them and they won't be downloaded again.
# DISABLE_ICON_DOWNLOAD=false

## Icon download timeout
## Configure the timeout value when downloading the favicons.
## The default is 10 seconds, but this could be to low on slower network connections
# ICON_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=10

## Icon blacklist Regex
## Any domains or IPs that match this regex won't be fetched by the icon service.
## Useful to hide other servers in the local network. Check the WIKI for more details
# ICON_BLACKLIST_REGEX=192\.168\.1\.[0-9].*^

## Any IP which is not defined as a global IP will be blacklisted.
## Usefull to secure your internal environment: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses for a list of IPs which it will block
# ICON_BLACKLIST_NON_GLOBAL_IPS=true

## Disable 2FA remember
## Enabling this would force the users to use a second factor to login every time.
## Note that the checkbox would still be present, but ignored.
# DISABLE_2FA_REMEMBER=false

## Controls if new users can register
# SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=true

## Controls if new users need to verify their email address upon registration
## Note that setting this option to true prevents logins until the email address has been verified!
## The welcome email will include a verification link, and login attempts will periodically
## trigger another verification email to be sent.
# SIGNUPS_VERIFY=false

## If SIGNUPS_VERIFY is set to true, this limits how many seconds after the last time
## an email verification link has been sent another verification email will be sent
# SIGNUPS_VERIFY_RESEND_TIME=3600

## If SIGNUPS_VERIFY is set to true, this limits how many times an email verification
## email will be re-sent upon an attempted login.
# SIGNUPS_VERIFY_RESEND_LIMIT=6

## Controls if new users from a list of comma-separated domains can register
## even if SIGNUPS_ALLOWED is set to false
# SIGNUPS_DOMAINS_WHITELIST=example.com,example.net,example.org

## Token for the admin interface, preferably use a long random string
## One option is to use 'openssl rand -base64 48'
## If not set, the admin panel is disabled
# ADMIN_TOKEN=Vy2VyYTTsKPv8W5aEOWUbB/Bt3DEKePbHmI4m9VcemUMS2rEviDowNAFqYi1xjmp

## Enable this to bypass the admin panel security. This option is only
## meant to be used with the use of a separate auth layer in front
# DISABLE_ADMIN_TOKEN=false

## Invitations org admins to invite users, even when signups are disabled
# INVITATIONS_ALLOWED=true

## Controls the PBBKDF password iterations to apply on the server
## The change only applies when the password is changed
# PASSWORD_ITERATIONS=100000

## Whether password hint should be sent into the error response when the client request it
# SHOW_PASSWORD_HINT=true

## Domain settings
## The domain must match the address from where you access the server
## It's recommended to configure this value, otherwise certain functionality might not work,
## like attachment downloads, email links and U2F.
## For U2F to work, the server must use HTTPS, you can use Let's Encrypt for free certs
# DOMAIN=https://bw.domain.tld:8443

## Yubico (Yubikey) Settings
## Set your Client ID and Secret Key for Yubikey OTP
## You can generate it here: https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/
## You can optionally specify a custom OTP server
# YUBICO_CLIENT_ID=11111
# YUBICO_SECRET_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# YUBICO_SERVER=http://yourdomain.com/wsapi/2.0/verify

## Duo Settings
## You need to configure all options to enable global Duo support, otherwise users would need to configure it themselves
## Create an account and protect an application as mentioned in this link (only the first step, not the rest):
## https://help.bitwarden.com/article/setup-two-step-login-duo/#create-a-duo-security-account
## Then set the following options, based on the values obtained from the last step:
# DUO_IKEY=<Integration Key>
# DUO_SKEY=<Secret Key>
# DUO_HOST=<API Hostname>
## After that, you should be able to follow the rest of the guide linked above,
## ignoring the fields that ask for the values that you already configured beforehand.

## Authenticator Settings
## Disable authenticator time drifted codes to be valid.
## TOTP codes of the previous and next 30 seconds will be invalid
## 
## According to the RFC6238 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238),
## we allow by default the TOTP code which was valid one step back and one in the future.
## This can however allow attackers to be a bit more lucky with there attempts because there are 3 valid codes.
## You can disable this, so that only the current TOTP Code is allowed.
## Keep in mind that when a sever drifts out of time, valid codes could be marked as invalid.
## In any case, if a code has been used it can not be used again, also codes which predates it will be invalid.
# AUTHENTICATOR_DISABLE_TIME_DRIFT = false

## Rocket specific settings, check Rocket documentation to learn more
# ROCKET_ENV=staging
# ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 # Enable this to test mobile app
# ROCKET_PORT=8000
# ROCKET_TLS={certs="/path/to/certs.pem",key="/path/to/key.pem"}

## Mail specific settings, set SMTP_HOST and SMTP_FROM to enable the mail service.
## To make sure the email links are pointing to the correct host, set the DOMAIN variable.
## Note: if SMTP_USERNAME is specified, SMTP_PASSWORD is mandatory
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.domain.tld
# SMTP_FROM=bitwarden-rs@domain.tld
# SMTP_FROM_NAME=Bitwarden_RS
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_SSL=true
# SMTP_EXPLICIT_TLS=true # N.B. This variable configures Implicit TLS. It's currently mislabelled (see bug #851)
# SMTP_USERNAME=username
# SMTP_PASSWORD=password
# SMTP_AUTH_MECHANISM="Plain"
# SMTP_TIMEOUT=15

# vim: syntax=ini
